(A) Use a config file to set machine options, instead of relying on hard-coded defaults
(A) Add configuration to support z-axis machines
(B) Configurable start/end sequence
(B) Option to sort paths by distance to reduce G0 distances
(B) Smooth curves should not use the control point when the previous curve is not of the same type (quadratic -> smooth cubic, cubic -> smooth quadratic) +bug
(C) Biarc interpolation (G2/G3 instead of many G1)
(C) Ellipse paths are dubious -- large_arc, sweep may need to be inverted +bug
